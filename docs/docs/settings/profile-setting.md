# Profile Setting

Configure the conditions of the test website. Platform can emulate popular devices (such as iPhone, iPad and Nexus phone), limit the network connection.

All project will have a default profile: Desktop, and its network throttling is unlimit.

:::warning

When **delete** profile, **all** snapshot report generated by this profile will also be deleted.

## Device emulation

We use Google Chrome device emulation and other factors to ensure the experience is as close as possible to the real device.

We provide the following devices emulation:

- iPhone 6
- iPhone 8
- iPhone X
- Nexus 5X
- Nexus 6P
- Pixel 2 XL
- iPad
- iPad Pro

When you set this parameter, the following effects will occur:

- Device viewport
- User-Agent with this device
- CPU slowdown multiplier

## Connection speed

Limit the connection speed of the browser by using preset network speed options.

The following network speed options are available:

| Label                   | Latency | Download    | Upload      | RTT   |
| ----------------------- | ------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----- |
| No bandwidth throttling | -       | -           | -           | -     |
| Slow 3G                 | 400ms   | 40.00 KB/s  | 40.00 KB/s  | 300ms |
| Good 3G                 | 150ms   | 196.61 KB/s | 96.00 KB/s  | 300ms |
| Regular 4G              | 170ms   | 1.52 MB/s   | 392.22 KB/s | 80ms  |

### React Profiling

:::caution Notice

This is an experimental feature which may be unstable in some circumstances. Please report an issue if it works unexpectedly.

It may slow down the rendering speed of pages.

:::
![](/settings/react-profiling.png)

By enabling this feature, timing information about each component thatâ€™s rendered in React applications will be collected during lab analysis.

Flamegraph will be shown in the snapshot report, which can help us to identify performance bottlenecks in React applications.

This feature is based on the use of React Profier API, which is disabled in the production build.
We solved this by intercepting the network request of `react-dom` and replace it with a profiling build.
